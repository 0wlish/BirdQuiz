        answer: "Ovenbird", 
        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "Based off of the orange crest with a black outline, this bird is not a Swainson's Thrush or a Song Sparrow. Golden-crowned Kinglets do not have spotting on their chest and are very small birds, so this is an Ovenbird."},
    {url: "img_19.jpg", 
        o1: "Neotropic Cormorant", o2: "Double-Crested Cormorant", o3: "Great Cormorant", o4: "Anhinga",

        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "Based off of range, it cannot be an Anhinga or a Neotropic Cormorant. These birds have all-black heads so they are most likely Double-crested Cormorants."},

        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "This bird has a thin beak, not a hooked beak, so it isn't a Northern Shrike or a Loggerhead Shrike. It also has white bars on its wings, which Grey Catbirds lack."},

        answer: "Great Blue Heron", 
        region: "NA", location: "Florida, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Although this may seem like a Great Egret, a Snowy Egret, or a Cattle Egret in non-breeding plumage, note the pale legs. This bird is also pure white, so it can't be a Cattle Egret in breeding plumage. This bird is a subspecies of the Great Blue Heron that is only found in Key West, Florida."},

        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "Great Blue Heron can be eliminated based off of body shape, it is lankier than our bird. Yellow-crowned Night Herons have a black throat, while this bird has a white throat. Green Herons have a dark red chest with white streaking, and this bird has an all-whitish grey chest."},

        region: "EU", location: "Spain", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "This bird has a black half-collar, which Rock Doves and Wood Pigeons do not have. A European Turtle Dove's collar is streaked with white, so this is a Eurasian Collared Dove."},

        region: "EU", location: "Spain", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Common Grackle can be eliminated based off of range. Eurasian Starlings have speckles and a yellow beak, and Spotless Starlings have a yellow beak and orange feet.

        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "This bird has the wrong body shape to be a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater or a Green Woodpecker. It has a red beak, and Monk Parakeets have a pale pink beak. Rose-ringed Parakeets are not native to Europe, but they have established colonies in warmer urban areas."},

        answer: "Monk Parakeet", 
        region: "EU", location: "Spain", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "Wrong body shape and coloration to be a Blue Tit or a Great Tit. This bird has a pale beak, and Rose-ringed Parakeets have a red beak. Monk Parakeets are introduced in parts of Europe, and have a thriving population. They build massive colonial nests in trees, and sometimes cause trees to collapse under the weight of the nest."},

        answer: "Grey Heron", 
        region: "EU", location: "France", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "This looks like a Great Blue Heron, but Great Blues are not found in France. Their European counterpart, with similar plumage but no overlapping range, is the Grey Heron."},

        o1: "Wild Turkey", o2: "Greater Prairie-chicken", o3: "Ring-necked Pheasant", o4: "Golden Pheasant", 
        answer: "Ring-necked Pheasant", 
        region: "NA", location: "New York, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Greater Prairie-chicken and Golden Pheasant can be eliminated based off of range. This bird appears to have the long, upright tail and green head of a male Ring-necked Pheasant."},

        o1: "Spotted Sandpiper", o2: "Solitary Sandpiper", o3: "Greater Yellowlegs", o4: "Dunlin", 
        answer: "Solitary Sandpiper", 
        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "This bird is darker than a Dunlin and has duller legs than a Greater Yellowlegs. It also has white spots on its back and faint brown streaking on its chest, so it is not a Spotted Sandpiper."},

        o1: "Roseate Tern", o2: "Forster's Tern", o3: "Common Tern", o4: "Least Tern", 
        answer: "Least Tern", 
        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Notice the pale orange bills and the white triangles on their foreheads. Common Terns, Roseate Terns, and Forster's Terns have more reddish-orange beaks and are larger birds."},

        o1: "Killdeer", o2: "Pacific Golden-plover", o3: "Black-bellied Plover", o4: "American Golden-plover", 
        answer: "American Golden-plover", 
        region: "NA", location: "New York, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "By plumage, we can eliminate the Killdeer, and by range, we can eliminate the Pacific Golden-plover. That just leaves the Black-bellied Plover and the American Golden-plover. Both birds are very similar, but the American Golden has a white stripe and a black spot on its head, while the Black-bellied only has a white spot."},

        answer: "House Sparrow", 
        region: "EU", location: "Estonia", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "Italian Sparrow can be eliminated based off of range. Eurasian Tree Sparrows have a brown cap, while this bird has a grey cap. Male Common Chaffinches are redder and have white bars on their wings, which this bird lacks."},

        answer: "Greater Yellowlegs", 
        region: "NA", location: "New Hampshire, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Note the pale grey back and the bright yellow legs. Spotted Sandpipers also have yellow legs, but they have a brown back. It would have been mean to have one of the options be a Lesser Yellowlegs."},

        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "Double-crested Cormorant and Wood Duck can be eliminated based off of plumage. One of these birds has a black and orange beak, which identifies it as a female Mallard, but the other duck has a solid yellow bill but lacks a green head. However, it has a white tail, which means that it is a male Mallard in non-breeding plumage."},

        o1: "Common Magpie", o2: "Western Jackdaw", o3: "Carrion Crow", o4: "Hooded Crow", 
        answer: "Hooded Crow", 
        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "Carrion Crow and Common Magpie can be eliminated based off of this bird's grey plumage. Western Jackdaws have similar plumage patterns to Hooded Crows, but Western Jackdaws have visibly pale eyes, which this bird does not have."},

        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Güldenstädt's Redstart can be eliminated through range. The Common Rock Thrush has scaly plumage, which this bird does not. Between the Black Redstart and the Common Redstart, the female Black Redstart is a cool grey while the female Common Redstart is more dusty."},

        o1: "Coal Tit", o2: "Blue Tit", o3: "Pied Wagtail", o4: "White Wagtail", 
        answer: "White Wagtail", 
        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "This bird's white spot extends over the eyes, while the Coal Tit's eyes are surrounded with black feathers and the Blue Tit has a black \"mask\" and a blue crown. The Pied Wagtail is a subspecies found in the British Isles."},
    {url: "img_63.jpg", 
        o1: "Italian Sparrow", o2: "House Sparrow", o3: "Eurasian Tree Sparrow", o4: "Spanish Sparrow", 
        answer: "Italian Sparrow", 
        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "House Sparrows and Spanish Sparrows are not found on the Italian peninsula, so they can be eliminated. This bird looks a lot like a Tree Sparrow, but it has a white supercilium (\"eyebrow\"), and it lacks the black spot that Tree Sparrows have on their cheeks. Italian Sparrows have both a white supercilium and a white cheek."},

        o1: "Great Egret", o2: "Cattle Egret", o3: "White Stork", o4: "Little Egret", 
        answer: "Cattle Egret", 
        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "Based off of range, the White Stork can be eliminated. These birds appear to have pale legs, unlike Great Egrets and Little Egrets. In addition, they're grazing in a field, while Great and Little Egrets are typically found near water."},

        o1: "Water Rail", o2: "Eurasian Moorhen", o3: "Eurasian Coot", o4: "Purple Swamphen", 
        answer: "Eurasian Moorhen", 
        region: "EU", location: "Italy", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "Based off of the red beak with a yellow tip, we can safely say that this is a Eurasian Moorhen. Water Rails are lighter grey, Eurasian Coots have a white beak, and the Purple Swamphen has an all-red beak."},

        answer: "Cooper's Hawk", 
        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "H", 
        notes: "When I was making this quiz, I thought this was an easy Red-tailed Hawk, but I thought I should check to be sure. The streaking is way to heavy to be a Red-tail! The yellow eye makes me thing that this is an immature bird. Immature Sharp-shinned Hawks and immature Broad-winged Hawks have blotchier streaking, so I believe this is an immature Cooper's Hawk. If you think I'm wrong, email me at tortugavpn@gmail.com."},

        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "M", 
        notes: "We can eliminate the Southern House Wren and the Pacific Wren based off of range and the Carolina Wren based off of the lack of its characteristic white stripe above the eye."},

        region: "NA", location: "Massachusetts, USA", difficulty: "E", 
        notes: "The Eastern Pheobe and the Eastern Wood-Pewee both lack the distinctive white stripe on the tip of the tail. The Barn Swallow has a V-shaped tail, not a rounded tail."},
