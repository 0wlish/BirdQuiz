    "answer": "Rose-ringed Parakeet", 
    "notes": "This bird has the wrong body shape to be a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater or a Green Woodpecker. It has a red beak, and Monk Parakeets have a pale pink beak. Rose-ringed Parakeets are not native to Europe, but they have established colonies in warmer urban areas."
