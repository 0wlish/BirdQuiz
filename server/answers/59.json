    "answer": "Mallard", 
    "notes": "Double-crested Cormorant and Wood Duck can be eliminated based off of plumage. One of these birds has a black and orange beak, which identifies it as a female Mallard, but the other duck has a solid yellow bill but lacks a green head. However, it has a white tail, which means that it is a male Mallard in non-breeding plumage."
