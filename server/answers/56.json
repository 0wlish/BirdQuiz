    "answer": "American Golden-plover", 
    "notes": "By plumage, we can eliminate the Killdeer, and by range, we can eliminate the Pacific Golden-plover. That just leaves the Black-bellied Plover and the American Golden-plover. Both birds are very similar, but the American Golden has a white stripe and a black spot on its head, while the Black-bellied only has a white spot."
