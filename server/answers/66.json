    "answer": "Cooper's Hawk", 
    "notes": "When I was making this quiz, I thought this was an easy Red-tailed Hawk, but I thought I should check to be sure. The streaking is way to heavy to be a Red-tail! The yellow eye makes me thing that this is an immature bird. Immature Sharp-shinned Hawks and immature Broad-winged Hawks have blotchier streaking, so I believe this is an immature Cooper's Hawk. If you think I'm wrong, email me at tortugavpn@gmail.com."
