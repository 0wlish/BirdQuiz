    "answer": "Great Blue Heron", 
    "notes": "Although this may seem like a Great Egret, a Snowy Egret, or a Cattle Egret in non-breeding plumage, note the pale legs. This bird is also pure white, so it can't be a Cattle Egret in breeding plumage. This bird is a subspecies of the Great Blue Heron that is only found in Key West, Florida."
