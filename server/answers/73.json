    "notes": "This duck has a clearly defined white supercilium (\"eyebrow\") and a black eyestripe, which female Eurasian Wigeons completely lack, and female Gadwalls only have a faint eyestripe. Female Garganeys have a similar eyestripe and supercilium, but Garganeys have a longer body compared to Mallards."
