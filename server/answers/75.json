    "answer": "Lesser Black-backed Gull",
    "notes": "Based off of its brown-grey mottled plumage, this is a first-winter birds. Yellow-legged Gull can be eliminated based off of range. This bird has an all-black beak, so it is not a first-winter European Herring Gull, which has a pink and black beak. Great Black-backed Gulls and Lesser Black-backed Gulls have very similar plumage, but Lesser Black-backed Gulls have noticably long wings, which this bird has. This is probably a Baltic Gull, a subspecies of the Lesser Black-backed Gull, but there is still some scientific confusion about what exactly a Baltic Gull is."
