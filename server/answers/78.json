    "answer": "Brant",
    "notes": "This bird has a long neck held straight and upright, which is the wrong body shape and posture for it to be a Common Loon or a Double-crested Cormorant. Canada Geese have a visible white cheek, but this bird appears to have an all-black head. Canada Geese rarely can have an all-black head, but this bird's stockier and smaller body shape, as well as its barely-visible white partial \"necklace\", indicates that this is a Brant."
