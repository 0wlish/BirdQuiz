    "answer": "Italian Sparrow", 
    "notes": "House Sparrows and Spanish Sparrows are not found on the Italian peninsula, so they can be eliminated. This bird looks a lot like a Tree Sparrow, but it has a white supercilium (\"eyebrow\"), and it lacks the black spot that Tree Sparrows have on their cheeks. Italian Sparrows have both a white supercilium and a white cheek."
