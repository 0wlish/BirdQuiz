    "answer": "Monk Parakeet", 
    "notes": "Wrong body shape and coloration to be a Blue Tit or a Great Tit. This bird has a pale beak, and Rose-ringed Parakeets have a red beak. Monk Parakeets are introduced in parts of Europe, and have a thriving population. They build massive colonial nests in trees, and sometimes cause trees to collapse under the weight of the nest."
